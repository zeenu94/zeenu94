# 👋 Hi, I'm Zainab Khurshid

I'm a **computational biologist** focused on large-scale genomics, rare variant analysis, and multi-omics data integration in neurodegenerative diseases.  
My PhD research at Boston University centers on **Alzheimer’s disease genetics**, integrating WGS/WES, RNA-seq, proteomics, and telomere biology to uncover molecular drivers of disease risk.
