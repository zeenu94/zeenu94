# 👋 Hi, I'm Zainab Khurshid

I'm a **computational geneticist and bioinformatics researcher** focused on large-scale genomics, rare variant analysis, and multi-omics data integration in neurodegenerative disease.  
My PhD research at Boston University centers on **Alzheimer’s disease genetics**, integrating WGS/WES, RNA-seq, proteomics, and telomere biology to uncover molecular drivers of disease risk.

### 🧬 Core Expertise
- **Genomic data processing:** WGS/WES, RNA-seq, and proteomic pipelines  
- **Statistical genetics:** GWAS, SKAT-O, burden tests, polygenic risk modeling  
- **Machine learning applications:** feature selection, biomarker prediction, multi-modal modeling

### 📊 Current Interests
- AI-driven genomics and target discovery  
- Scalable workflows for rare variant and multi-omic analyses  
  

---
Most of my current work is on institutional clusters and protected datasets, but I’m excited to share open examples soon.
### 📁 Coming Soon
I’m in the process of preparing example repositories showcasing:
- Reproducible WES/WGS variant-calling and QC pipelines  
- RNA-seq differential expression and co-expression workflows  
- Integrative scripts for PRS and ML-based biomarker prediction
